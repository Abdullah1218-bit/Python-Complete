📁 Python Fundamentals Repository Summary
==========================================

This repository covers essential and advanced Python programming concepts, structured folder-wise. Below is a summary of each section:

1. 🔹 Advance Python 1
   - Contains advanced concepts beyond the basics such as lambda functions, higher-order functions, built-in modules, list comprehensions, etc.

2. 🔹 Function and Arguments
   - Covers function declaration, positional and keyword arguments, default arguments, return statements, and nested functions.

3. 🔹 Functions: Pass and Break
   - Demonstrates usage of `pass`, `break`, `continue` inside loops and functions for control flow handling.

4. 🔹 Input Output
   - Teaches how to take user input and display output using `input()`, `print()`, formatting strings, and f-strings.

5. 🔹 List, Tuple, Sets, Dictionary
   - A comprehensive guide to Python’s core data structures:
     - Lists: append, pop, slicing, comprehension
     - Tuples: immutable structures
     - Sets: unique data handling
     - Dictionaries: key-value mappings, `.get()`, `.items()`

6. 🔹 Loops
   - Detailed examples of `for` loops, `while` loops, nested loops, `break`, `continue`, and `range()`.

7. 🔹 OOPs (Professional)
   - Full object-oriented programming coverage including:
     - Class and Object creation
     - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
     - Constructors (`__init__`) and method definitions
     - Best practices for clean OOP code

8. 🔹 OOPs
   - Introduction to OOP concepts for beginners. Lays the foundation before the professional-level folder.

9. 🔹 Practice
   - Contains various Python practice problems and exercises to build logic and mastery through coding.

10. 🔹 Tables and Stars
   - Fun and logical coding exercises involving:
     - Multiplication tables
     - Star patterns using nested loops

11. 🔹 If-Else
   - Conditional statements:
     - `if`, `else`, `elif`
     - Logical operators and ladder patterns
